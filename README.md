# RoboticVision.
This is a robotic vision that I designed. Powered by PyTesseract and pyhon 3.10.7.

To use RoboticVision you need to install: pytesseract, opencv-python, PyAutoGUI, numpy, pyscreenshot (via pip3).
Some features can be changed (for example, data output delay, automatic program stop, and so on).
